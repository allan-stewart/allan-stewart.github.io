<p>I love writing code.
Over the years as I have learned to do it professionally, I have found that I am as interested in the
methodologies and practices around software development as I am about actually writing code.
I am an advocate for Agile and Lean methods combined with practices such as test driven development,
continuous integration, and continuous delivery.</p>
<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.emmersionlearning.com/">Emmersion Learning</a> as the lead architect.
Previously, I was on the architecture team at <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a>
where I spent some time as the technical lead on a team practicing <a href="http://mobprogramming.org">mob programming</a> daily.
I am a regular attendee of the <a href="http://utahsc.org/">Utah Software Craftsmanship</a> group
and I speak at local conferences and meetups.</p>
<p>You can find me on

<p>I was interested in computers and code from a young age.
The catalyst for me getting into a software development career was working on simulator
controls in HyperCard for the Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center.
This led me to earn a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Computer Science.</p>
<p>After graduation from college, I found that I still had a lot to learn to be an effective professional.
I wanted to write software <em>well</em> rather than just get a job done,
so learning about better ways to write software became important to me.
On the job experiences (both positive and negative) taught be much,
but lacking a strong mentor I relied on the Internet and books.
The following books have had the most impact on how I think about software development:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clean Code</em> by Robert C. Martin</li>
<li><em>The Clean Coder</em> by Robert C. Martin</li>
<li><em>This Is Lean: Resolving the Efficiency Paradox</em> by Niklas Modig &amp; Pär Åhlström</li>
<li><em>The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride</em> by Sandro Mancuso</li>
<li><em>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable</em> by Patrick Lencioni</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that we need more professionalism in our industry.
Individuals need to choose that path and demonstrate the value to businesses.
When applied collaboratively in teams, the professional&#39;s practices make those teams more effective.
And once we&#39;ve found practices that work, we need to share them with others.</p>
