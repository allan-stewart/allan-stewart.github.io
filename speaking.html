            <h1 id="speaking">Speaking</h1>
<p>I enjoy speaking on topics about software development.
I have presented at a number of conferences, both public and within the companies I have worked for.</p>
<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
<p>Here are some of the topics I am currently speaking on:</p>
<h3 id="mob-programming">Mob Programming</h3>
<p>Mob programming is described by Woody Zuill as &quot;all the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer.&quot;
In this talk, I discuss my experiences with teams that practice mob programming daily, including fully remote teams.
I cover what mob programming is, the principles that make it effective, and many of the benefits it provides.</p>
<p>A version of this talk was recorded at a virtual meeting of the <a href="https://slcnet.tech/">SLC.NET User Group</a>:</p>

<h3 id="your-architecture-is-coupled-to-your-culture">Your Architecture is Coupled to Your Culture</h3>
<p>Can the culture of your company negatively impact your software architecture?
Should your desired software architecture lead to changing how teams are structured in your organization?
In this talk I will discuss how this hidden coupling affects software projects and give some specific examples of how Pluralsight leveraged it.</p>
<h3 id="software-craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship</h3>
<p>There is a growing movement within the software industry that calls for people who write code to act and be treated more professionally.
Software craftsmanship is a way to do so.
This presentation covers aspects of craftsmanship and why both developers and employers should want it practiced.</p>
<h2 id="speaker-bio">Speaker Bio</h2>
