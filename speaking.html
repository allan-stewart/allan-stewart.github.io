            <h1 id="speaking">Speaking</h1>
<p>I enjoy speaking on topics about software development.
I have presented at a number of conferences, both public and within the companies I have worked for.</p>
<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
<p>Here are some of the topics I am currently speaking on:</p>
<h3 id="2-5-years-of-mob-programming">2.5 Years of Mob Programming</h3>
<p>Mob programming is described by Woody Zuill as &quot;all the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer.&quot;
In this talk, I discuss my experiences on a team that practiced mob programming daily.
I cover what mob programming is, the principles that make it effective, and many of the benefits it provides.</p>
<h3 id="levels-of-abstraction-and-the-single-responsibility-principle">Levels of Abstraction and the Single Responsibility Principle</h3>
<p>Writing code is inherently an exercise in abstraction.
How can a better understanding of abstractions help us follow the single responsibility principle and write better code?
Can these concepts be applied outside of code at the library or service level?</p>
<h3 id="software-craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship</h3>
<p>There is a growing movement within the software industry that calls for people who write code to act and be treated more professionally.
Software craftsmanship is a way to do so.
This presentation covers aspects of craftsmanship and why both developers and employers should want it practiced.</p>
<h2 id="speaker-bio">Speaker Bio</h2>
